Building rmapper is easy - it requires a C compiler (gcc and icc have been
used during development) and gmake. Intel's C Compiler (icc) is highly
recommended as it is often at least 10-20% faster than gcc.

Please note that rmapper is x86-only. Pentium 4 architectures seem to benefit
considerably from 64-bit compiled code, whereas Core 2 architectures don't
seem to care much.

When building with icc, execute the following:
    gmake CC="icc" CFLAGS="-Wall -Werror -wd981,1572 -axP -O3 -ipo -static" \
        LDFLAGS="-lm"

When building with gcc, execute the following:
    gmake CC="gcc" CFLAGS="-Wall -Werror -O3 -mmmx -msse -msse2 -static" \
        LDFLAGS="-lm"

You may want to adjust your flags depending on your hardware and compiler
versions. The above icc CFLAGS seemed optimal for both Pentium 4 and Core 2
architectures.
