1.2.1: June ?, 2009
	- Fix a few Sun Studio Compiler portability bugs. 
	- rmapper-ls: make it clear when S-W Threshold is absolute vs.
	  fractional. 
	- Make the vector sw algorithm bail upon set up if the match value
	  times the maximum read length exceeds 32767, since this it the
	  highest score we can attain with pre-SSE4 16-bit instructions.
	  Correspondingly, divide the rmapper S-W defaults by 10 to make
	  longer reads work.
	- Add a -T flag to rmapper, which when set causes tie-breaks to
	  be broken in the opposite order during full alignment. This
	  should help alignment gaps line up when negative alignments are
	  reverse-complemented and lined up against positive ones.
	- Add a -U flag to rmapper, which outputs a list of unmapped reads
	  after all of the alignments. See the README for more information.
	- Add experimental support for multiple spaced seeds (enabled by
	  passing multiple '-s' arguments to rmapper.
	- Add the 'shrimp_var' utility, which prints detailed variations
	  detected for specific hits.
	- Handle uracil better for rna alignments, especially in colourspace.
	- Fix a bug that was pruning kmers with wobble bases or
	  uracil unnecessarily.
	- Misc. bug fixes.
	- Misc. documentation updates.

1.2.0: February 27, 2009
	- Reduce memory usage substantially by dynamically allocating the
	  hit heap, rather than preallocating it all up front in rmapper.
	- Various probcalc fixes.
	- Added 'probcalc_mp' utility for matepair analysis.
	- Fixes to compile under Sun Studio 12 for Solaris x86 and amd64.
	- Treat '-' in fasta file sequences (often found in individual,
	  aligned haplome sequences) as spaces, i.e. ignore them.
	- Added experimental support for larger seeds, up to a span of 128 with
	  any weight up to 128. Should work fine, but performance
	  characteristics haven't been evaluated.
	- Misc. documentation updates.

1.1.0: July 19, 2008
	- Yet another new output format with edit strings to concisely
	  describe the read->reference changes.
	- Fixed a nasty strict aliasing bug.
	- rmapper scores are now sorted (again) and duplicates are removed.
	- Added rates calculation input to probcalc so that rates may be
	  computed in parallel, joined, and then probabilities computed
	  in parallel as well.
	- Fixed a number of problems in probcalc's equations, small number
	  handling, and now output in scientific notation.
	- prettyprint-* will now only use memory in proportion to the input set,
	  rather than pulling all reads into memory.
	- All programs and utilities now accept both regular and gzip'd input
	  files.
	- Fixed missed cycle handling in SOLiD reads.
	- Fixed a bug in printing fringe genome bases on the negative strand.
	- Fixed a bug that improperly reverse-complemented the middle 8 bases
	  in a contig.
	- Various speed improvements.
	- Initial DAG aligner implementation for Helicos Single-Molecule
	  Sequencing.
	- Converted miscellaneous tools to python and moved them to utils/.
	- Misc. bug fixes.

1.0.5: March 25, 2008
	- Increased spaced seed weight by 2 for letter space, as 454 and
	  Illumina/Solexa reads are generally longer than AB.
	- Changed default gap open penalty from -300 to -400.
	- Changed default crossover penalty from -120 to -140 (for ABI SOLiD).
	- Disabled kmer pruning by default. This feature sometimes prunes too
	  many kmers and confuses users. It still offers an important speed-up,
	  but the user should be aware of (and responsible for) its use.
	- Fixed handling of wobble codes on the negative strand.
	- Handle `.' ambiguous bases as `N'.
	- Fixed whitespace and MS-DOS newline fasta parsing problems affecting
	  Illumina/Solexa and 454 users.
	- Fixed wobble code handling for negative strands.
	- Added read length relative parameters to rmapper. Now -h, -v, and -w
	  can take either absolute or percentage arguments (differentiated by
	  a '.' or '%' in the string). This allows more flexible score
	  thresholding and windowing for input with differing read lengths
	  (454, especially).
	- Fixed a few GCC 4 compiler warnings.

1.0.4: January 24, 2008
	- Changed rmapper default parameters to be more appropriate for the
	  human genome.
	- Applied fixes to the full colourspace Smith-Waterman algorithm. In
	  some cases we were not tracing back into the proper matrix. Initial
	  crossovers are now charged.
	- Added Phil Lacroute's mergehits utility.
	- Taught rmapper and prettyprint to handle multiple contigs per genome
	  file.
	- Fixed a minor bug that would miss hits within the first window of a
	  contig.
	- Fixed a bug in probcalc that would recalculate rates on non-regular
	  files.
	- Added surrounding bases to pretty-printed genome output.
	- Taught probcalc and prettyprint to handle symlinks.
	- Taught probcalc to accept multiple results arguments as both files and
	  directories of files.
	- Taught SHRiMP about wobble codes (by considering them as mismatches).
	- Added -S flag to probcalc and made double pass mode the default (now
	  probcalc uses much less memory at a higher runtime cost).
	- Added -C and -F options to rmapper to specify the strand.
	- Misc. portability and compilation fixes.
	- Misc. documentation updates.

1.0.3: Fall 2007
	- Internal development version. S-W fixes and probcalc double pass.

1.0.2: November 6, 2007
	- Fix invalid assertion in common/output.c:output_pretty.
	- probcalc progress bar disabled by default (enabled by -B flag).
	- Misc. documentation updates.

1.0.1: November 2, 2007
	- First public release. New output format.
	- '-b', '-p' flags changed to '-B', '-P'. (Parameters lowercase,
	  options uppercase).
	- Multiple contig support and internal reverse-complementing of contigs.

1.0.0: Summer 2007
	- Internal development version. Old ouput format.
