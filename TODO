0) There should be a 'shrimp' script in the root directory that wraps all
   sorts of functionality and generally makes things very trivial to use.
1) There is some code duplication, for instance in fasta parsers.
2) The fasta parsing code is doubtlessly going to choke on some slightly
   different formats someday.
3) str* operations are often not done safely. We should add local strl*
   functions and use them.
4) Output file formats are a bit ugly and no single facilities exist for
   parsing them. There's one centralised output facility, but none for input.
5) Many outputs could probably benefit from spacing parameters to printf,
   rather than inserting spaces in the code.
6) Pre-calculate and cache translations of reads, so as not to do them over
   again for each S-W call. This may improve CS vectored performance a fair bit.
